# Fire Alarm Arduino Project 

This is my Computer Systems Architecture coursework where I developed a portable fire alarm system using 2 Arduino microcontrollers. 

The primary objective is to enhance fire detection and alerting capabilities in various environments.

```
Key Components:

Inputs: 
-> Light sensors 
-> Push button
-> Potentiometer 

These inputs play a critical role in monitoring environmental conditions and user interactions.

Outputs: 
-> LCD screen
-> LEDs 
-> Piezo buzzer
-> DC motor 

These outputs are responsible for displaying information, providing visual and auditory alerts, and simulating emergency responses.
